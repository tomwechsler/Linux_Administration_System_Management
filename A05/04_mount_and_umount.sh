To access the filesystem, it needs to be mounted. This was seen briefly with the ISO file and the
btrfs FS. The FS is mount to a mount-point and not drive letters as used in other OSs. The
mount-point is a directory in the root filesystem. Mounting by the UUID rather than device
name ensures uniqueness and protects against hardware renaming.
